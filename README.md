# Hash Function Implementation in C++

This project implements a hash function in C++ for educational purposes. The hash function can be used for various applications such as hash tables, cryptographic applications, or data integrity checks.

## Features

- Simple hash function implementation
- Example usage and tests

## Prerequisites

- C++17 or later

## Building the Project

To build the project, use CMake. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fedoralife/password-encoder-and-decoder.git
    ```

2. Go to The scripts folder and run the bash script run.sh it will automatically build the project and run it:
    ```sh
    cd Scripts
    bash run.sh
    ```
4. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cmake --build .
    ```

## Running the Tests

-- Use the make_file_for_test for you to run a test executable file.
1. First change  make_file_for_test.txt to maketestfile.
2. Then build it via make.
3. Finally run the test executable.
