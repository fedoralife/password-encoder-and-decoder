# Hash Function Implementation in C++

This project implements a hash function in C++ for educational purposes. The hash function can be used for various applications such as hash tables, cryptographic applications, or data integrity checks.

## Features

- Simple hash function implementation
- Example usage and tests

## Prerequisites

- C++17 or later

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hash-function-cpp.git
    cd hash-function-cpp
    ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. Configure the project using CMake:
    ```sh
